# Assembler

The assembler here has been borrowed from Prof. Alexander Stoytchev's i281 CPU database, which can be found here:

[i281 CPU Software](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~alexs/classes/i281_CPU/)

The Bubble Sort assembly file has also been obtained from this directory. This folder contains the following files:

- Java assembler
- Assembly file for whichever program we wish to run (eg. BubbleSort)
- 5 Verilog files, 3 of which (`User_[].v`) are generated by the assembler

To generate the 3 Verilog files, run the following commands while in the Assembler directory:

```
javac i281assembler.java
java i281assembler ./BubbleSort.asm
```

`BubbleSort` may be replaced by whichever assembly file we wish to use.
